{"name":"Citygate","body":"# Citygate [<img src=\"https://secure.travis-ci.org/zamith/citygate.png\" />](http://travis-ci.org/zamith/citygate)\r\n\r\nCitygate is a rails engine that provides your application with user authentication (on the site or through facebook or google) using Devise and fully customizable authorization using CanCan.\r\n\r\nIt also provides a customizable backend for administrating all your users, using pjax and pushState making your website as fast as responsive as you ever wanted it to be.\r\n\r\n## Instalation\r\n\r\nFirst add the gem to your Gemfile to get the latest stable version\r\n\r\n    gem \"citygate\"\r\n\r\nor go on the edge with\r\n\r\n    gem \"citygate\", :git => \"https://zamith@github.com/zamith/citygate.git\"\r\n\r\n## Database Configuration\r\n\r\nIn order to get the database ready to run citygate you will need to fetch the migrations\r\n\r\n    rake citygate:install:migrations\r\n\r\nand run them\r\n\r\n    rake db:migrate\r\n\r\nthen drop this line at your `db/seeds.rb` file in order to be able to populate the db with the needed records\r\n\r\n    Citygate::Engine.load_seed\r\n\r\nand finally run the seeds command to actually populate the db\r\n\r\n    rake db:seed\r\n\r\n## Routes Configuration\r\n\r\nTo get all the citygate routes working you just need to mount them by adding the following line to your `config/routes.rb` file\r\n\r\n    mount Citygate::Engine => \"/\"\r\n\r\n## Environment Configuration\r\n\r\nSince citygate will send confirmation emails to any user that signs up, you will need to have your email configured.\r\n\r\nIn case of development add this to `config/environments/development.rb`\r\n\r\n    config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }\r\n\r\n## Citygate Options\r\n\r\nYou can change citygate's defaults by editing your `config/application.rb` file like so\r\n\r\n    Citygate::Engine.configure do\r\n      config.option = value\r\n    end\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\nThe available options are:\r\n\r\n* **will_paginate_options** - a hash with any option supported by [paginate](https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/wiki)\r\n* **mount_path** if you mount the engine in any other path than \"/\", must define it here as well so that omniauth can be aware of it\r\n\r\n## Running Citygate\r\n\r\nUsers in citygate will not be able to login with their google account if you use WEBrick, due to its url length limitation. Therefore run your server in development with `rails s thin`, to run the thin server.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Note:* Do not forget to check the routes made available to you by Citygate with `rake routes` and to take a look at the doc at [RubyDoc](http://rubydoc.info/github/zamith/citygate/master/frames)","tagline":"User management and authentication engine.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
