Citygate is a rails engine that provides your application with user authentication (on the site or through facebook or google) using Devise and fully customizable authorization using CanCan.

It also provides a customizable backend for administrating all your users, using pjax and pushState making your website as fast as responsive as you ever wanted it to be.

== Instalation

First add the gem to your Gemfile to get the latest stable version

  gem "citygate"

or go on the edge with

  gem "citygate", :git => "https://zamith@github.com/zamith/citygate.git"

== Database Configuration

In order to get the database ready to run citygate you will need to fetch the migrations

  rake citygate:install:migrations

and run them

  rake db:migrate

then drop this line at your +db/seeds.rb+ file in order to be able to populate the db with the needed records

  Citygate::Engine.load_seed

and finally run the seeds command to actually populate the db

  rake db:seed

== Routes Configuration

To get all the citygate routes working you just need to mount them by adding the following line to your +config/routes.rb+ file

  mount Citygate::Engine => "/"

== Environment Configuration

Since citygate will send confirmation emails to any user that signs up, you will need to have your email configured.

In case of development add this to +config/environments/development.rb+

  config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }

== OmniAuth Configuration

Citygate needs your facebook apps identifiers which are loaded from a file you must create called +config/accounts.yml+ and has the following format:

  facebook:
    app_id: "your app id from https://developers.facebook.com/apps"
    app_secret: "your app secret from https://developers.facebook.com/apps"

In case you are wondering, the reason it is not required for you to add your google OAuth identifier is because it is the same for everyone. It then redirects you to a authentication service within google servers.

== Loading Assets

In order to have the javascript added by Citygate you need to include it in your manifest file, like so:

  //= require citygate

== Citygate Options

You can change citygate's defaults by editing your +config/application.rb+ file like so

  Citygate::Engine.configure do
    config.option = value
  end

=== Options

The available options are:

will_paginate_options:: an hash with any option supported by paginate[https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/wiki]
mount_path:: if you mount the engine in any other path than "/", must define it here as well so that omniauth can be aware of it
no_of_users:: limit the number of users allowed in your system

== Running Citygate

Users in citygate will not be able to login with their google account if you use WEBrick, due to its url length limitation. Therefore run your server in development with <tt>rails s thin</tt>, to run the thin server.
